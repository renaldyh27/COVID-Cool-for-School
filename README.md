This project was submitted to the 'COVID-19 Border Communities Data Challenge' and won the challenge.

COVID-19 has impacted the school systems significantly in San Diego County. Since schools are finally opening back up, an important question arises regarding these schools: "Is it covid cool for school?". More formally, the question really means: "based on the conditions that we know today, is it safe enough for children to go back to in-person instructions at their school?"
